                <p>King Mendax, rules over The Petrum Urbs of Erebos, land of the mischivious tricksters, known for good deeds that come in a price, and unkown mischief. The king is not known for his strength in battle, but for his wit of trade, not having much to offer when it comes to land makes it an easy place to defend, and when you help everyone and harm everyone it's hard to make enemies. The king is constantly balancing between hated and loved. When he is hated he is protected by the Royal Knights of Erebos. nine cunning and swift fey'ri warriors always surrounding him and his wife Queen Petrum. the Fey'ri out of sight, waiting ahead and behing wherever there king is going and has been.</p><br><br>

                <p>They Warriors are not the only fey'ri in The Petrum urbs of Erebos but they are the strongest and most cunning. shrowded by the shadows they hide and wait to strike. most of the time they are purly for defense, but a little gentle persuasion and necissary every now and then.</p>
